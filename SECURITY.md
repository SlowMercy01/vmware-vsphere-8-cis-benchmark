## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### 1. Do Not Create Public Issues
- **Do not** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities
- **Do not** discuss the vulnerability in public forums or social media

### 2. Report Privately
Send a detailed report to: **25517637+uldyssian-sh@users.noreply.github.com**

Include the following information:
- **Description**: Clear description of the vulnerability
- **Impact**: Potential impact and affected components
- **Reproduction**: Steps to reproduce the vulnerability
- **Environment**: PowerShell version, OS, and VMware environment details
- **Proof of Concept**: If applicable, include PoC code (safely)

### 3. Response Timeline
- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Assessment**: Within 5 business days
- **Resolution**: Based on severity (see below)

### 4. Severity Levels

#### Critical (24-48 hours)
- Remote code execution
- Privilege escalation
- Data exfiltration

#### High (1 week)
- Authentication bypass
- Significant data exposure
- Service disruption

#### Medium (2 weeks)
- Information disclosure
- Denial of service
- Configuration vulnerabilities

#### Low (1 month)
- Minor information leaks
- Non-security bugs with security implications

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

#### Environment Security
```powershell
# Use service accounts with minimal permissions
$serviceAccount = "domain\vsphere-audit-svc"

# Ensure read-only access only
Get-VIPermission -Principal $serviceAccount | Where-Object { $_.Role -notlike "*ReadOnly*" }
```

#### Network Security
```powershell
# Verify encrypted connections
Set-PowerCLIConfiguration -InvalidCertificateAction Warn -Confirm:$false

# Use specific vCenter FQDN
Connect-VIServer -Server "vcenter.secure.domain.com" -Protocol https -Port 443
```

#### Credential Management
```powershell
# Use Windows Credential Manager
cmdkey /add:vcenter.domain.com /user:domain\username /pass

# Or use secure credential objects
$secureCredential = Get-Credential -Message "vCenter Authentication"
```

#### Report Security
```powershell
# Store reports in secure locations
$secureReportPath = "\\secure-server\audit-reports\$(Get-Date -Format 'yyyy-MM')"

# Set appropriate permissions
icacls $secureReportPath /grant "Audit-Team:(R)" /inheritance:r
```

### For Developers

#### Code Security
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling prevents information leakage
- **Logging**: Secure logging without sensitive data exposure
- **Dependencies**: Regular security scanning of dependencies

#### PowerShell Security
```powershell
# Use approved verbs and secure coding practices
[CmdletBinding()]
param(
    [Parameter(Mandatory = $false)]
    [ValidateNotNullOrEmpty()]
    [string]$vCenterServer
)

# Sanitize inputs
$vCenterServer = $vCenterServer.Trim()
if ($vCenterServer -notmatch '^[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+$') {
    throw "Invalid vCenter server name"
}
```
